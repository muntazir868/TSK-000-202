 Preprocess and transform the data, handling missing values, encoding
categorical variables, and performing feature engineering.
 Train a classification model, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, or gradient boosting algorithms.
 Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall,
or area under the ROC curve.
